## OpenSFDI: an open hardware project for label-free measurements of tissue optical properties with spatial frequency domain imaging

#### Overview
Spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) is a diffuse optical measurement technique that can quantify tissue optical absorption and reduced scattering on a pixel by-pixel basis. Measurements of absorption at different wavelengths enable the extraction of molar concentrations of tissue chromophores over a wide field, providing a noncontact and label-free means to assess tissue viability, oxygenation, microarchitecture, and molecular content. In this talk, I will describe openSFDI, an open-source guide for building a low-cost, small-footprint, multi-wavelength SFDI system capable of quantifying absorption and reduced scattering as well as oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations in biological tissue. The openSFDI project has a companion website which provides a complete parts list along with detailed instructions for assembling the openSFDI system. I will also review several technological advances our lab has recently made, including the extension of SFDI to the shortwave infrared wavelength band (900-1300 nm), where water and lipids provide strong contrast. Finally, I will discuss several preclinical and clinical applications for SFDI, including applications related to cancer, dermatology, rheumatology, cardiovascular disease, and others.

#### Speaker
Darren Roblyer is an associate professor of Biomedical Engineering at Boston University. His research focuses on translational diffuse optical imaging and spectroscopy. His group develops both wearables and frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy techniques to address unmet clinical needs in cancer, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease. He received his BS degree in biomedical engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 2004 and received his PhD in bioengineering at Rice University in 2009.
