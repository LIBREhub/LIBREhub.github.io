# 2024 Seminar Series

Building on the momentum of our well-received seminars in 2022 and 2023, we are excited to announce the 2024 seminar series! This ongoing program fosters a vibrant community of researchers, practitioners, and students passionate about pushing the boundaries of bioimaging using open-source hardware. This year, we'll continue to host a series of talks featuring leading researchers and rising stars in the field. Expect a diverse range of topics, from cutting-edge microscopy and medical imaging techniques to the latest applications in biomedicine and biotechnology.

We also want to keep the seminar series dynamic and representative of the diverse interests within our bioimaging community. That's why we are opening the floor for nominations. Do you know a speaker whose research would inspire and educate our audience? Are you working on a open-hardware project that could revolutionize bioimaging? We encourage you to submit your nominations to librehub@uc.cl
