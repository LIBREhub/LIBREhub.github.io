## Overview
At the National Research Council of Canada we are building an open source transmission electron microscope. We have designed and built all of our own hardware, electronics and software and want to share it with the community to further the development. It uses electrostatic lenses and a 50 kV source and I will present some recent results and the unique capabilities of the setup.
