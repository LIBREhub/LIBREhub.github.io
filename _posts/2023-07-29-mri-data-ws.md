## MRI: Processing your own data

### Hands-on workshop | Date: 20-21 November, 2023

<br>

We are thrilled to invite you to an exciting hands-on workshop on getting fundamental insights into MRI technology. The expected educational outcomes are:

1. Implement simple reconstruction techniques, considering sampling frequency, field of view and other standard parameters.
2. Know the existence of standard file formats for raw data and sequences.
3. Use reconstruction software that implement parallel imaging and compressed sensing.
4. use correction algorithms for motion and off-resonance.

Spaces are limited, so we encourage you to reserve your spot soon. To register or learn more about the workshop, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1t6vIy6f927LOWd6t0XrYuNuV4qDPr5M6NuBx5VCz4Fo/prefill).

We look forward to seeing you and embarking on this exciting journey together of open-source technologies!
