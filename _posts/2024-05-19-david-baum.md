## A modular, free and open source graphical interface for visualizing and processing electrophysiological signals in real-time

<br>

### Overview
Portable biosensors become more popular every year. In this context, I propose NeuriGUI, a modular and cross-platform graphical interface that connects to those biosensors for real-time processing, exploring and storing of electrophysiological signals. The NeuriGUI acts as a common entry point in brain-computer interfaces, making it possible to plug in downstream third-party applications for real-time analysis of the incoming signal. NeuriGUI is 100% free and open source.
