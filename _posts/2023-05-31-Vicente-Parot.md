#### Overview
In this presentation, I will discuss several research projects that highlight the importance of precise illumination control in microscopy, particularly in high-speed multicolor imaging applications. I will begin by examining some common light sources and modulation methods used in microscopy. Then, I will present our implementation of a multimode, continuous-wave fiber laser illumination module specifically adapted for bioimaging researchers in Latin America, along with modifications we have made in comparison with similar designs. Additionally, I will highlight our progress in developing a versatile and affordable light control unit that offers manual and automated operation options for high-speed switching and independent current control of LED and fiber laser sources. 

#### Speaker
Vicente Parot run his lab at Catholic University of Chile. Vicente is interested in developing computational imaging tools to study neuroscience and to advance medical microendoscopy. Vicente trained as undergraduate student at Catholic University of Chile with Pablo Irarrazaval, as graduate student at Harvard with Adam Cohen, and as postdoc at Massachusetts General Hospital with Brett Bouma. He joined Catholic University as Assistant Professor in 2020, where he also teaches IBM2122 Biomedical Engineering Design.
