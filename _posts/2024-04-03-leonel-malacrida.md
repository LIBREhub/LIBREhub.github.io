## The phasor plot analysis for hyperspectral imaging and time-resolved imaging: PhasorPy developments and its applications

<br>

### Overview
In this talk, I will introduce the transformative potential of phasor plots in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). This approach streamlines HSI and FLIM analysis by minimizing expertise requirements. We have applied phasor plots to various applications, including label-free pathology analysis in skin HSI data. Additionally, we are developing PhasorPy, an open-source Python library, to facilitate phasor analysis for HSI and FLIM data. I will discuss the library's current modules and outline future perspectives for its development in the coming months.
