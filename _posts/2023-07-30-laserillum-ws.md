## Low-Cost Laser Illumination for Microscopy

### Hands-on workshop | Date: 11-12 December, 2023

<br>

We are thrilled to invite you to an exciting hands-on workshop where participants will learn how to build and use a low-cost, modular fiber-coupled laser light source for microscopy. Spaces are limited, and travel funds are limited, so we encourage you to reserve your spot soon. Please register using [**this form**](https://forms.gle/p1hhrFmtSUmxEyZE7).

We look forward to seeing you and embarking on this exciting journey together of open-source technologies!

### Update: Technical information

The workshop kit includes:

1. Laser diode coupled to multimode optical fiber with a 105μm core and 2m length,
1. Metal heat sink,
1. Current source for the laser diode.

These three components have an approximate cost over USD 200. The diode included in the kit may be:
* 405 nm, 300 mW (violet),
* 488 nm, 55 mW (blue, typically used for green fluorescence excitation), or
* 638 nm, 700 mW (red).

Their bandwidths are not documented; other similar multimode laser diodes have a bandwidth of about 2 nm.

**Laser Colors:** The default laser module in the workshop kit will be blue; If you have a color preference please justify your selection in the registration form under "3) Provide other impact indicators ...". If you would be interested in registering for assembling and keeping kits for more than one color, please submit the registration form again justifying the color and confirming your willingness to pay the registration fee for each kit independently. The assignment of colors and multiple kits will be subject to availability and prioritization with a selection process based on the impact statement.

In the workshop, we will provide training on assembling and operating these elements safely, together with other additional low-cost elements in the kit, including:

4. Additional electronics to power the laser,
1. Collimation of the laser beam,
1. Support pieces for holding the laser module and optical fiber,

### Update: General expense reimbursement conditions

* LIBRE hub may cover some of the attendees' expenses to participate in the workshop, NOT including registration payments.
* What can LIBRE hub pay for? The organization can only reimburse transportation or accommodation expenses, that are justified by the distance between the participant's origin location and the workshop location. 
* How does it work? The financing method is reimbursement of approved expenses: you will need to pay for approved expenses, to then request their reimbursement. Reimbursement requests that are not previously approved in writing by the organization will not be processed.
* How much can I be reimbursed? We have limited funds for attendees' expenses. Each applicant requesting funds will be informed of a max amount for reimbursement upon confirmation of their registration. Funds will be allocated and prioritized based on form information provided by applicants, and are subject to availability.
* What other general conditions are there?
  * Expenses must be backed up by a receipt matching the dates and locations of the workshop and of travel origin.
  * Expenses must be in the name of the person who is the registered participant in the workshop. Reimbursement requests will not be processed for expenses to the name of other persons, or in the name of a company or organization.
  * Reimbursement will be provided in Chilean peso (CLP) or US dollars (USD), any requests in other currencies will be reimbursed in USD using exchange rates defined by the Central Bank of Chile.
  * Reimbursements requested after the workshop begins will take ~4 weeks to process, and will be payed by bank transfer.

**Please note:** This event was originally announced for Dec 14-15; now the schedule has been updated to Dec 11-12 due to conflict with other activities in the organization team.
