## Low-Cost Laser Illumination for Microscopy

### Hands-on workshop | Date: 11-12 December, 2023

<br>

We are thrilled to invite you to an exciting hands-on workshop on building, using, and modifying our laser illumination module for microscopy that uses a single color fiber-coupled laser diode and a speckle diffuser. Spaces are limited, so we encourage you to reserve your spot soon. To register or learn more about the workshop, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/p1hhrFmtSUmxEyZE7).

We look forward to seeing you and embarking on this exciting journey together of open-source technologies!

**Please note:** This event was originally announced for Dec 14-15; now the schedule has been updated to Dec 11-12 due to conflict with other activities for the organizers.
