# Low-Cost Laser Illumination for Microscopy

### Hands-on workshop | Date: 11-12 December, 2023

<br>

### General Information

Welcome to the site of "Low-Cost Laser Illumination for Microscopy" workshop, an exciting hands-on workshop where participants learned how to build and use a low-cost, modular fiber-coupled laser light source for microscopy. This event was held on December 11 and 12, 2023, in [San Joaquin] campus (https://www.uc.cl/universidad/nuestros-campus/san-joaquin/), Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile. The [LIBRE hub](https://librehub.github.io/people/) team sponsored by [Chang Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI)](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) was in charge of this workshop.

<!--Spaces are limited, and travel funds are limited, so we encourage you to reserve your spot soon. Please register using [this form](https://forms.gle/p1hhrFmtSUmxEyZE7).

We look forward to seeing you and embarking on this exciting journey together of open-source technologies!

### Assembly instructions

The assembly instructions, bill of materials, and source files can be found on the following link: [https://librehub.github.io/fiber-coupled-laser-illumination/](https://librehub.github.io/fiber-coupled-laser-illumination/)
 
### Technical information

The workshop kit includes:

1. Laser diode coupled to multimode optical fiber with a 105μm core and 2m length,
1. Metal heat sink,
1. Current source for the laser diode.

These three components have an approximate cost over USD 200. The diode included in the kit may be:
* 405 nm, 300 mW (violet),
* 488 nm, 55 mW (blue, typically used for green fluorescence excitation), or
* 638 nm, 700 mW (red).

Their bandwidths are not documented; other similar multimode laser diodes have a bandwidth of about 2 nm.

**Laser Colors:** The default laser module in the workshop kit will be blue; If you have a color preference please justify your selection in the registration form under "3) Provide other impact indicators ...". The assignment of colors will be subject to availability and prioritization with a selection process based on the impact statement.

In the workshop, we will provide training on assembling and operating these elements safely, together with other additional low-cost elements in the kit, including:

4. Additional electronics to power the laser,
1. Collimation of the laser beam,
1. Support pieces for holding the laser module and optical fiber,

### Update: General expense reimbursement conditions

* LIBRE hub may cover some of the attendees' expenses to participate in the workshop, NOT including registration payments.
* What can LIBRE hub pay for? The organization can only reimburse transportation or accommodation expenses, that are justified by the distance between the participant's origin location and the workshop location. 
* How does it work? The financing method is reimbursement of approved expenses: you will need to pay for approved expenses, to then request their reimbursement. Reimbursement requests that are not previously approved in writing by the organization will not be processed.
* How much can I be reimbursed? We have limited funds for attendees' expenses. Each applicant requesting funds will be informed of a max amount for reimbursement upon confirmation of their registration. The assignment of funds will be subject to availability and prioritization with a selection process based on applicants' information.
* What other general conditions are there?
  * Expenses must be backed up by a receipt matching the dates and locations of the workshop and of travel origin.
  * Expenses must be in the name of the person who is the registered participant in the workshop. Reimbursement requests will not be processed for expenses to the name of other persons, or in the name of a company or organization.
  * Reimbursement will be provided in Chilean peso (CLP) or US dollars (USD), any requests in other currencies will be reimbursed in USD using exchange rates defined by the Central Bank of Chile.
  * Reimbursements requested after the workshop begins will take ~4 weeks to process, and will be payed by bank transfer.
