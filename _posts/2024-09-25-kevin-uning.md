## Open Raman Microscopy (ORM): A modular Raman spectroscopy setup with an open-source controller
<br>

### Overview
Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique for identifying chemical species by probing their vibrational energy levels, offering exceptional specificity with a relatively simple setup involving a laser source, spectrometer, and microscope/probe. However, the high cost of Raman systems lacking modularity often limits exploratory research hindering broader adoption. To address the need for an affordable, modular microscopy platform for multimodal imaging, we present a customizable confocal Raman spectroscopy setup alongside an open-source acquisition software, ORM (Open Raman Microscopy) Controller, developed in Python. This solution bridges the gap between expensive commercial systems and complex, custom-built setups used by specialist research groups. In this presentation, we will cover the components of the setup, the design rationale, assembly methods, limitations, and its modular potential for expanding functionality. Additionally, we will demonstrate ORMâ€™s capabilities for instrument control, 2D and 3D Raman mapping, region-of-interest selection, and its adaptability to various instrument configurations. We will conclude by showcasing practical applications of this setup across different research fields.
