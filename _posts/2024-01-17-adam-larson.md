# Planktoscope: A democratized high-throughput imaging platform for quatifying plankton abundance and diversity

<br>

### Overview
Planktoscope is an open-source microscope platform that dramatically enhances our ability to visualize and quantify plankton abundance and diversity in aquatic environments. Its modular design enables high-resolution imaging of a wide range of plankton sizes, while onboard computing supports automated detection and data compilation, even in remote, unconnected areas. This affordable, scalable tool is especially valuable for large area surveys and aims to deepen our understanding of plankton dynamics while enhancing the predictive capabilities of harmful algal bloom (HAB) events. With capabilities ranging from detailed visualization of plankton morphology to broad data collection by citizen scientists, Planktoscope facilitates comprehensive studies on HAB distributions, biogeography, and oceanographic associations. This democratized approach offers a unique combination of advanced imaging and vast, community-driven data collection, paving the way for new insights into plankton ecology and environmental stewardship.

### Speaker
Adam Larson, PhD. Bioengineering, Stanford University.
