# Low-Cost Fourier Ptychography Microscope

[![Esteban_Vera](http://img.youtube.com/vi/0U16qJQFn-Y/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/0U16qJQFn-Y) 

#### Overview
We present an advanced low-cost wide-field, high-resolution computational microscope kit based on Fourier ptychography. The microscope is integrated by using a collection of easy to find off-the-shelf components. By implementing the Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) technique, we are able to acquire and synthetically produce wide field-of-view images at high resolutions, exceeding the original limitations of the optical system. The system works by iteratively updating a mosaiced high resolution Fourier spectrum from a collection of images of a sample captured at different illumination angles. We provide the design of the low-cost kit and also the results obtained by several tests performed with a calibration target and blood samples, demonstrating an increase in resolution while preserving the original wide field-of-view of the objective lens used.

#### Speaker
Dr. Esteban Vera received a B.S. degree and Engineering diploma in electronics engineering in 1996 and 1999, respectively, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering in 2003 and 2010, respectively, all from the Universidad de Concepción, Concepción, Chile. From 2001 to 2007, he worked as an electronics engineer for different large telescope projects, first with the Paranal Observatory and then with the Gemini Observatory. In 2010, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA. In 2013, he became a Research Scientist at Duke University, Durham, NC, USA. In 2016, he joined the School of Electrical Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparaiso, Chile, where he is currently an Associate Professor. His research interests span computational imaging, compressed sensing, inverse problems, signal processing, machine learning, and scientific and astronomical instrumentation development. Since 2022, Dr. Vera has served as an associate editor for Optics Express and the IEEE Open Journal on Signal Processing.
