## Open SPM: A Modular Framework for Scanning Probe Microscopy
<br>

**Overview:** 
OpenSPM aims to democratize innovation in the field of scanning probe microscopy (SPM), which is currently dominated by a few proprietary, closed systems that limit user-driven development. Our platform includes a high-speed OpenAFM head and base optimized for small cantilevers, an OpenAFM controller, a high-voltage amplifier, and interfaces compatible with several commercial AFM systems such as the Bruker Multimode, Nanosurf DriveAFM, Witec Alpha SNOM, Zeiss FIB-SEM XB550, and Nenovision Litescope. We have created a fully documented and community-driven OpenSPM platform, with training resources and sourcing information, which has already enabled the construction of more than 15 systems outside our lab. The controller is integrated with open-source tools like Gwyddion, HDF5, and Pycroscopy. We have also engaged external companies, two of which are integrating our controller into their products or interfaces.

We see growing interest in applying parts of the OpenSPM platform to related techniques such as correlated microscopy, nanoindentation, and scanning electron/confocal microscopy. To support this, we are developing more generic and modular software, alongside a structured development workflow. A key feature of the OpenSPM system is its Python-based API, which makes the platform fully scriptable and ideal for AI and machine learning applications. This enables, for instance, automatic control and optimization of PID parameters, setpoints, and experiment workflows. With a growing contributor base and industry involvement, OpenSPM is well positioned to become a global, open platform for next-generation SPM innovation.
