# Advances in the Low-Cost MRI Project for Accesible Imaging

### General Information

We are thrilled to invite you to an exciting workshop where we will describe and discuss the current state of development of our low-cost MRI system. This system leverages existing open-source designs engineered to make medical imaging more accessible, especially in low-resource settings. Our team will showcase the design and manufacturing of various components: main field, gradient coils and amplifiers, RF coil and amplifier, shimming, and the console.

This event will be held on December 16, 2024, in [San Joaquin](https://www.uc.cl/universidad/nuestros-campus/san-joaquin/) campus, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, and is organized by the [LIBRE hub](https://librehub.github.io/people/) team with support from [Chang Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI)](https://chanzuckerberg.com/).
