## Human Reference Atlas and Data Visualization Construction and Usage
<br>

**Overview:** 
The HuBMAP Human Reference Atlas (HRA) effort aims to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body, see HRA Portal at [https://humanatlas.io](https://humanatlas.io). An international team of organ experts across 25+ consortia are authoring so called ASCT+B tables that capture the partonomy and typology information for anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers used to identify cell types. The ASCT+B tables are used to revise and extend existing CCF-relevant ontologies. In close collaboration with NIAID at NIH, a 3D Reference Object Library was compiled ([https://3d.nih.gov/collections/hra](https://3d.nih.gov/collections/hra)) that provides semantically annotated 3D representations of major anatomical structures captured in the ASCT+B tables.

The HRA can be extended and explored using several interactive user interfaces: The Registration User Interface (RUI, [https://apps.humanatlas.io/rui](https://apps.humanatlas.io/rui)) supports tissue data registration and annotation across 50+ 3D reference organs. The Exploration User Interface (EUI, [https://apps.humanatlas.io/eui](https://apps.humanatlas.io/eui)) supports exploration of semantically and spatially explicit data—from the whole body to the single cell level. The Cell Distance Explorer (CDE, [https://apps.humanatlas.io/cde](https://apps.humanatlas.io/cde)) computes and visualizes distance distributions between different cells, cell types, and anatomical structures and cell types and morphological features. For an introduction to HuBMAP goals, data, and code visit the Visible Human MOOC (VHMOOC, [https://expand.iu.edu/browse/sice/cns/courses/hubmap-visible-human-mooc](https://expand.iu.edu/browse/sice/cns/courses/hubmap-visible-human-mooc)). This talk details how HRA and other data visualizations can be constructed and used to harmonize, analyze, and explore data at scale in support of data- driven decision making.
