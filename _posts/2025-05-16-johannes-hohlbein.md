## Open microscopy in the life sciences: Sharing is caring
<br>

**Overview:** 
Together with other colleagues interested in open science, we published in 2022 a manuscript on the past, presence and future potential of open microscopy [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01602-3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01602-3). Here, I will iterate on some of the key points and how they are relevant in 2025 with a focus on single-molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM). SMLM allows monitoring molecular interactions in, for example, live bacterial cells and other complex samples. To increase the general accessibility and affordability of SMLM, we developed the miCube microscopy framework. Shortly after, we witnessed many other groups coming up with new ideas and improvements in addition to our own developments. I will present some of our work on developing algorithms for SMLM data analysis, addition of adaptive optics for localising proteins in turbid media and a simple scheme for spectrally resolved SMLM. These few examples demonstrate the huge potential of open microscopy in enabling interdisciplinary science and lowering the threshold for researchers to find the best solutions for their scientific imaging challenges.
