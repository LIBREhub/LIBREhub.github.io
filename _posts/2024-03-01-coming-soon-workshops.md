# 2025 Hands-on workshops

<br>

We're thrilled to announce that hands-on workshops dedicated to open-hardware bioimaging will be offered this year! Open-hardware empowers researchers and students to create customized bioimaging tools that perfectly fit their needs. By fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing, it promotes affordability and transparency within scientific exploration. These workshops are your chance to dive into the world of open-hardware bioimaging, develop new skills, and network with fellow researchers.

We'll be releasing details on the list of workshops soon, so keep an eye out!
