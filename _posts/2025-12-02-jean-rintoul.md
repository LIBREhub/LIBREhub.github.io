## Open Electrical Impedance Tomography
<br>

**Overview:** 
Biomedical imaging has historically been large and expensive, restricting the communities that can access these technologies from both a health and development perspective. The open electrical impedance tomography project ([https://openeit.github.io/](https://openeit.github.io/)) is a research tool changing this. In this presentation, we'll describe how electrical impedance tomography works, its similarity to other well known biomedical imaging methods like the CT scan, and its neighbor technique - bioimpedance spectroscopy which presents new routes to material differentiation. Finally, we'll describe how the project came into existence and future plans for higher resolution images.

**Speaker:** Dr. Jean Rintoul, Research Fellow at Mindseye Labs
