#### Overview
The Flamingo is our compact and powerful custom microscope platform. It features the same components as our stationary setups, but has a modular design that supports multiple configurations. The Flamingo helped us to become more flexible in the lab, serving as a fully equipped base for microscope development. In addition, it enabled us to bring our collaborations to a new level. Now, we can move custom microscopes right to where the samples are located, enabling new and exciting imaging experiments much quicker.

#### Speaker
Dr Jan Huisken co-invented light sheet microscopy and has pioneered quantitative imaging approaches in developmental biology. Besides pushing the technology and enabling novel biological applications, he works to make the technology accessible to everyone interested.

Dr. Huisken has been director of Medical Engineering at Morgridge Institute for Research and Visiting Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States, since 2016. He joined EMBL in Heidelberg as a doctoral researcher in 2000 and completed his doctorate in physics at the University of Freiburg in 2004. Huisken then worked as a postdoc at the University of California, San Francisco, United States. Back in Germany from 2010 to 2016, he became a research group leader at the MPI of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics and was awarded an ERC Consolidator Grant in 2015. He has also received awards from the British Royal Microscopical Society, the US National Institutes of Health and the 2020 Lennart Nilsson Award. In October 2021 he took up his position as a Humboldt Professor.
