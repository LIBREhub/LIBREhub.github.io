## MRI for everybody, everywhere

<br>

Dear LIBRE hub community,

We invite you to the next LIBRE hub seminar on October 18 at 13.30 hrs (GMT-3 / Chile Time) via Zoom. For this session, we welcome Dr. Joseba Alonso to hear about "MRI for everybody, everywhere".

**Speaker:** Joseba Alonso, Institute for Molecular Instrumentation and Imaging (i3M), Spanish National Research Council and Polytechnic University of Valencia.

**Overview:** The virtues of MRI are abundant and far-reaching. However, MRI is accessible only to the privileged and not as often as desirable, mainly because they are expensive. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the state of the art of low-cost and portable MRI systems. They are based on low-field magnets and have to compensate for the loss in signal-to-noise ratio with smart engineering, pulse-sequence design, and reconstruction and data processing techniques. I will also present our latest results with a portable system, hard-tissue low-field imaging for dental MRI, and a high-performance open-source console for controlling low-field MRI systems.

Please join our discussion on Zoom.
