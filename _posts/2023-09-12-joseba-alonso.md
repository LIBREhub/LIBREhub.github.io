#### Overview
The virtues of MRI are abundant and far-reaching. However, MRI is accessible only to the privileged and not as often as desirable, mainly because they are expensive. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the state of the art of low-cost and portable MRI systems. They are based on low-field magnets and have to compensate for the loss in signal-to-noise ratio with smart engineering, pulse-sequence design, and reconstruction and data processing techniques. I will also present our latest results with a portable system, hard-tissue low-field imaging for dental MRI, and a high-performance open-source console for controlling low-field MRI systems
