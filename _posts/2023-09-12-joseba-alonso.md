## Simpler MRI: An MRI scanner using the Diligent Analog Discovery 2 and more

<br>

Dear LIBRE hub community,

We invite you to the next LIBRE hub seminar this Wednesday, September 13 at 13.30 hrs (GMT-3 / Chile Time) via Zoom. For this session, we welcome Dr. Steven M. Wright to hear about "Simpler MRI: An MRI scanner using the Digilent Analog Discovery 2 and more".

**Speaker:** Steven M. Wright, Magnetic Resonance Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University.

**Overview:** FPGA-based desktop scanners and new magnet designs are making MRI more accessible than ever before. We discuss and show images from a teaching scanner using the Digilent Analog Discovery 2 which requires no FPGA programming and only a few minor hardware components. Continuing with ‘simpler is better’, we discuss approaches to multinuclear MRI that can simplify scanner construction and in particular the development of multi-nuclear array coils.

Please join our discussion on Zoom this Wednesday.
