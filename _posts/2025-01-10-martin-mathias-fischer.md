## Insights into BioImaging Innovation
<br>

We are pleased to invite you to the next LIBRE Hub seminars, which will take place on **January 17th at 12:30 PM** (GMT-3, Chile time) via Teams:

### "The Builders Working Group of BioImaging North America (BINA)"

**Speaker:** Martin C. Fischer, Ph.D., Research Professor, Departments of Chemistry and Physics, Duke University.

**Overview:** The BINA Builders Working Group aims to create a diverse and inclusive community of builders, adopters, and users of custom microscopes and microscopy tools. Currently, many of these techniques are developed in research groups and, despite their tremendous usefulness to the broader community, few get disseminated or adopted outside the developing group. The Builders Working Group wants to bring together builders, adopters, users, and industrial representatives to publicize and discuss microscope designs and tools, exchange build information for existing designs, and provide a forum to incubate new design ideas. I will discuss initiation and the current status of this community effort.

### "Cost-effective, open-source light shutters with Arduino control"

**Speaker:** Mathias S. Fischer, Department of Mechanical Engineering, North Carolina State University

**Overview:** Shutters are commonly used to block various light paths in a wide range of optical experiments. Many high-performance commercial shutters are available, but they are often quite expensive. I will describe an open-source design for a low-cost, general purpose shutter system based on widely available actuators (servo motors or solenoids) that are connected to an Arduino-based controller. The shutters can be controlled via a display built into the controller, by serial commands via USB, or by electrical control lines. The designs for all required components are publicly available, including 3D print files for the actuator holders and cases, the Arduino code, libraries for serial communication, and a graphical user interface for testing.
