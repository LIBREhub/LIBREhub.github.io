## Toward globally accessible neuroimaging: Building the OSI2ONE MRI Scanner in Paraguay

<br>

### Overview
The Open Source Imaging Initiative has recently released a fully open source low field MRI scanner called the OSI2ONE. We are currently building this system at the Universidad Paraguayo Alemana in Asuncion, Paraguay for a neuroimaging project at a clinic in Bolivia. I will discuss the process of construction, important considerations before you build, and future work planned with this device.

### Speaker
Joshua Harper, PhD. Universidad Paraguayo Alemana, Professor of Engineering.
