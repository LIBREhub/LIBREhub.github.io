## **Brain Slice Recovery for All-Optical Neurophysiology**

In the preparation of acute brain slices for all-optical neurophysiology, a critical step occurs immediately after sectioning with a vibratome. Slices must be incubated in Artificial Cerebrospinal Fluid (ACSF) at 37°C and continuously gasified with Carbogen (95% O2, 5% CO2).

Standard beakers can often lead to tissue damage due to overcrowding or direct contact with gas bubbles. This modular, 3D-printed support system allows slices to be held safely within commercial cell strainers while floating at the surface of the ACSF, ensuring optimal gas exchange and structural integrity of the delicate neuronal tissue.

*Note: This system is designed to complement our [3D Printed Perfusion Chamber](/2025/12/31/perfusion-chamber.html), which is used for the subsequent imaging phase.*

#### **1\. Fabrication and Design**

The system consists of three main 3D-printed parts: a radial support, a top locking ring, and the central hub. Using PLA is recommended for these parts because it is lightweight and allows the entire assembly to float naturally in the ACSF.

The design is fully parametric in Onshape, meaning it can be adjusted to fit different cell strainer brands, varying beaker diameters, or to accommodate more or fewer wells depending on the experiment's throughput needs.

#### **2\. Assembly**

The assembly integrates the printed PLA supports with the commercial cell strainers. The strainers fit into the radial arms, and the top lock ensures they remain securely in place even when moved or when the liquid is agitated by gasification.

#### **3\. Installation and Use**

Once assembled, the cell strainers are placed into the support. The entire unit is then submerged in a 1-liter beaker filled with ACSF. Because the support floats, the slices remain at a consistent depth near the surface, where gasification is most effective.

1. **Setup:** Place the support inside the 1L beaker.  
2. **ACSF:** Fill with ACSF until the bottom mesh of the strainers is fully submerged.  
3. **Gasification:** Introduce the Carbogen line with a stone diffuser. The floating design prevents the strainers from tipping over or sinking as the liquid level changes or moves.

The CAD models are open-source and can be customized for your specific laboratory hardware:
