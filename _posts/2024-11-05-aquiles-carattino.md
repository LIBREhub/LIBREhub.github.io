### Overview
There are many examples of academic spin-outs created on traditional technology transfer, but just a handful built on open hardware. In this talk I will showcase the impact of open hardware on the creation of two products at Dispertech, my first company. I will also review the challenges associated with technology transfer of open designs, the roles of patents and other forms of intellectual property. Finally, I will discuss about potential business models and the value open hardware can deliver.

### Speaker
Aquiles Carattino, PhD. Physicist and entrepreneur in technological innovation products, focused on commercialization to democratize access to science.
