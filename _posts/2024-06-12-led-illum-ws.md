#### Location: [San Joaquin campus](https://www.uc.cl/universidad/nuestros-campus/san-joaquin/), Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile

We are thrilled to invite you to an exciting hands-on workshop where participants will learn how to build and use a low-cost, modular fiber-coupled laser light source for microscopy. Spaces are limited, and travel funds are limited, so we encourage you to reserve your spot soon. Please register using [this form](https://forms.gle/47WS9HtJJj3Si5is7).

We look forward to seeing you and embarking on this exciting journey together of open-source technologies!

### Update: Technical information

The workshop kit includes:

1. High power LED module including a condenser lens,
1. Metal heat sink,
1. Current source,
1. Manual intensity adjustment knob. 

These components have an approximate cost over USD 50. The kit will contain a single LED of one color. Optionally we can provide an additional LED in white or alternative colors, subject to preferences and availability. The LED module in the kit has been tested with UV (~400nm), blue (~490nm), green (~530nm), amber (~568nm), red (~630nm), or white. Their bandwidths are not well documented; other similar LEDs have a bandwidth of about 40 nm.

**LED Colors:** The default LED module in the workshop kit will be blue; If you have a color preference or a specific application need please justify your selection in the registration form (submit again if necessary) under "3) Provide other impact indicators ...". 

In the workshop, we will provide training on assembling and operating these elements safely, together with other additional low-cost elements as part of the kit, and all tools needed for assembly and testing.

### Update: General expense reimbursement conditions

* LIBRE hub may cover some of the attendees' expenses to participate in the workshop, NOT including registration payments.
* What can LIBRE hub pay for? The organization can only reimburse transportation or accommodation expenses, that are justified by the distance between the participant's origin location and the workshop location. 
* How does it work? The financing method is reimbursement of approved expenses: you will need to pay for approved expenses, to then request their reimbursement. Reimbursement requests that are not previously approved in writing by the organization will not be processed.
* How much can I be reimbursed? We have limited funds for attendees' expenses. Each applicant requesting funds will be informed of a max amount for reimbursement upon confirmation of their registration. The assignment of funds will be subject to availability and prioritization with a selection process based on applicants' information.
* What other general conditions are there?
  * Expenses must be backed up by a receipt matching the dates and locations of the workshop and of travel origin.
  * Expenses must be in the name of the person who is the registered participant in the workshop. Reimbursement requests will not be processed for expenses to the name of other persons, or in the name of a company or organization.
  * Reimbursement will be provided in Chilean peso (CLP) or US dollars (USD), any requests in other currencies will be reimbursed in USD using exchange rates defined by the Central Bank of Chile.
  * Reimbursements requested after the workshop begins will take ~4 weeks to process, and will be payed by bank transfer.
