## Simpler MRI: An MRI scanner using the Diligent Analog Discovery 2 and more

#### Overview
FPGA-based desktop scanners and new magnet designs are making MRI more accessible than ever before. We discuss and show images from a teaching scanner using the Digilent Analog Discovery 2 which requires no FPGA programming and only a few minor hardware components. Continuing with ‘simpler is better’, we discuss approaches to multinuclear MRI that can simplify scanner construction and in particular the development of multi-nuclear array coils.
