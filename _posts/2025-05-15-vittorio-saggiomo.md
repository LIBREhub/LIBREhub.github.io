## Open Hardware Microfluidics
<br>

**Overview:** 
What’s the point of having scientific and technological innovations when only a few can benefit from them? How can we make science more inclusive? Those questions are always in the back of my mind when we perform research in our laboratory, and we have a strong focus on the scientific accessibility of our developed methods from microfabrication to sensor development.
In this presentation, I will give some examples of our microfluidic open technology approach. One of the first examples of this approach can be seen in our microfluidics fabrication method, usually done with expensive machinery and by highly trained scientists. We simplify this process and now you can make microfluidics practically at home.  

Recently, we have also proven that cheap 3D printers’ hardware and software can be repurposed for automation in the lab. This approach is cheap, fast, and simple to reproduce. We have transformed 3D printers into sets of syringe pumps, an automatic tissue staining machine, and automatic microscopes.
