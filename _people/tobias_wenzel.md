Tobias Wenzel runs his [lab](https://wenzel-lab.github.io/) at Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering.

Dr. Wenzel is Assistant Professor at the Institute of Biological and Medical Engineering of the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile (UC). He obtained his Masters degree (2013) and PhD (2017) from the University of Cambridge, Department of Physics, and performed postdoctoral research at the Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology at Cambridge until 2018. He then held an interdisciplinary Marie Curie Fellowship at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany, before joining the IIBM end of 2020.

Dr. Tobias Wenzel is a bioengineer studying human and environmental microbiomes by developing microfluidic methods for high-throughput multi-omics screens. The research of his lab focuses on in-vitro and single cell analysis (interactions, genomics, cultivation, phenotyping) by drawing on biophysics (self-organisation, micro-and nanostructuration, optics & photonics, modeling) and Open Source Hardware automation.
